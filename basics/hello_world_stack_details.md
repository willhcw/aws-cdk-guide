# Details for hello_world_stack.py

The `hello_world_stack.py` file defines the AWS resources for your stack. This file includes `HelloWorldStack`, a class extending `Stack`.

1. **Importing Modules**:
   - Import CDK modules to define AWS services and resources.
   ```python
   import uuid
   from aws_cdk import (
      Stack,
      aws_s3 as s3,
      RemovalPolicy
   )
   from constructs import Construct
   ```

2. **Creating the Stack Class**:
   - Define the `HelloWorldStack` class, specifying `scope`, `id`, and other configurations.
   ```python
   class HelloWorldStack(Stack):
       def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)
   ```

3. **Defining Resources**:
   - Inside `HelloWorldStack`, add an S3 bucket with a unique name and a removal policy. This ensures the bucket is deleted when you run `cdk destroy`, preventing it from being retained in AWS.

   ```python
   # Generate a unique bucket name with a random UUID suffix
   bucket_name = f"my-hello-world-bucket-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"

   # Define an S3 bucket with the unique name and a removal policy to delete on stack destroy
   s3.Bucket(
       self,
       "MyHelloWorldBucket",
       bucket_name=bucket_name,
       versioned=True,
       removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY  # Ensures bucket deletion on `cdk destroy`
   )
   ```

### Explanation of `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY`
Setting `removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` ensures that the S3 bucket is deleted when `cdk destroy` is executed. By default, CDK may retain some resources, like S3 buckets, even after the stack is destroyed. This setting prevents unnecessary retention and helps clean up resources efficiently.
